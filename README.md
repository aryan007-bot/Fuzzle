## Project Overview

Fuzzle is an innovative, blockchain-based monster collection and breeding game built on the Aptos blockchain. Players can create, collect, breed, and trade unique digital monsters ("Fuzzles") with distinct genetics and elemental properties, all fully owned on-chain. The project combines dynamic gameplay, robust technology, and augmented reality to offer a next-generation web3 gaming experience.
